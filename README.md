# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ”­
I'm a Senior Software Engineer with a knack for building (and shipping!) great products. I started my journey in mobile app development with React Native, and have since expanded into full-stack territoryâ€”handling backend projects with Golang and PHP, and building modern web experiences using Next.js, TypeScript, and JavaScript.

My go-to tools:
- React Native
- TypeScript & JavaScript
- Golang
- Next.js

## ðŸŒ±
Lately, Iâ€™m exploring the world of AI toolsâ€”learning how to use them as helpful copilots on my journey (because I believe AI should help me reach my destination, not be the one who's driving).

I'm also taking steps toward a managerial path: leading people, not just projects. I already have hands-on experience guiding teams and overseeing projects at my current company, and I find real satisfaction in helping others grow and succeed.

Impostor syndrome? Thatâ€™s my secret weapon. It keeps me curious, humble, and always leveling up.

## ðŸ‘¯
I like my code (and my life) minimalist, but with a dash of personality. If youâ€™re up for building something coolâ€”and maybe having a little fun along the wayâ€”letâ€™s connect!
